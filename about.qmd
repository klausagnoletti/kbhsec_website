KbhSec is the Copenhagen branch of [CitySec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/wiki/meetups/citysec/), a collection of informal meetups for like-minded security professionals. 

CitySec groups meet to discuss topics of interest in a non-work, non-vendor setting; preferably while drinking (responsibly).
